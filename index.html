        <h2>1.1. ISO/OSI model</h2>
        <p>We divide communication processes into smaller parts (layers) to make them more manageable. Each layer has a specific function and communicates only with adjacent layers.Layering simplifies the design, promotes modularity and interoperability, and makes updates and enhancements easier.</p>
        <p>The ISO/OSI model, created by the International Organization for Standardization, defines how communication between computing systems should occur through a layered architecture, which separates the protocols into seven layers:</p>

        </table>
        <p>The <b>physical layer</b> includes the hardware used for data communication, such as cables and switches. In this layer, data is converted into a bit stream. Some examples are Ethernet (physical part), USB and DSL.</p>
        <p>The <b>data link layer</b> facilitates the connection between two machines on the same network. It focuses on flow control and error detection in intra-network communication. This layer can be divided into the MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer and the LLC (Logical Link Control) sublayer. Some examples are ARP, HDLC and PPP.</p>
        <p>The <b>network layer</b> enables data transfer between different networks. It is responsible for data routing, determining the best path to the destination. Common protocols in this layer include IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IGMP, and IPsec.</p>
        <p>The <b>transport layer</b> ensures that data packets arrive in the correct order and without loss or errors, providing segmentation, error control and flow management. Examples include TCP and UDP.</p>
        <p>The <b>session layer</b> manages sessions between two devices. The time between the start and end of communication is known as a session. It is responsible for ensuring that the session remains open long enough to transfer the data and is closed promptly to avoid wasting resources. It also handles synchronization with checkpoints and recovery in long data exchanges. Examples include NFS and SMB.</p>
        <p>The <b>presentation layer</b> prepares the data to be used by the application layer. It is responsible for data translation, compression and encryption. Compression makes communication faster and more efficient by reducing the amount of data to be transmitted. Examples include TLS/SSL, JPEG and MPEG.</p>
        <p>The <b>application layer</b>, also known as the human-computer interaction layer, provides network services directly to user applications. It is where protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP and DNS operate.</p>

        <h2>2.1. Ping command</h2>
        <p>I used the <code><b>ping google.com</b></code> command to verify network connectivity to <code>google.com</code>.

        <p>
            As we can see in the screenshots, during the Wireshark capture we observed these protocols: DNS, ICMP, ARP, TCP and TLS.<br>
            However, the protocols directly involved in this communication are <b>DNS</b>, <b>ICMP</b> and <b>ARP</b>, since the others correspond to background system traffic (e.g., SNI=edge.microsoft.com)

        <p> Additionally,  when we inspect the DNS packets in Wireshark, we can see that DNS uses the <b>UDP</b> protocol at the transport layer:</p>
